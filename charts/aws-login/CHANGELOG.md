## [1.0.0] - 2018-09-26
### Added
Added (optional) TLS block in ingress resource.
You can set the `ingress.addTlsBlock` value to `false` if your
ingress-controller doesn't work when ingress resources have this block (e.g.
[traefik](https://traefik.io) doesn't seem to work)

### Changed
`ingress.*` values structure changed so now you'll just pass a single
host in `ingress.host` instead of an array in `ingress.hosts`.

**NOTE**: You values files will need to change accordingly.
