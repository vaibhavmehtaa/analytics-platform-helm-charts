## [0.5.2] - 2020-06-15
### Changed
Bumped auth-proxy from `v5.2.5` to `v5.2.6`.

This is a maintenance release which upgrades some of its dependencies.
Few of these new dependencies also fix some potential security
vulnerabilities.

See Release Notes for more: https://github.com/ministryofjustice/analytics-platform-auth-proxy/releases/tag/v5.2.6


## [0.5.1] - 2020-01-31
### Changed
Bumped auth-proxy from `v5.2.1` to `v5.2.4`.

This version updates some of the dependencies, [including
`handlebars` `4.7.2`](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/analytics-platform-auth-proxy/pull/214)
which fixes a security vulnerability.

See:
- https://github.com/ministryofjustice/analytics-platform-auth-proxy/releases/tag/v5.2.4
- https://github.com/ministryofjustice/analytics-platform-auth-proxy/releases/tag/v5.2.3


## [0.5.0] - 2020-01-21
### Changed
Give containers fixed cpu and memory to guarantee QoS


## [0.4.6] - 2019-11-04
### Changed
Diffent approach to long `host` labels.
Truncate to 63 chars was not good enough if the 63th
character happened to be a dot (`.`) because labels
can't end with a dot.

To maintain compatibility with existing clusters, charts
and unidler:
- if the length of `host` label value is <= 63 the value
  is the full host (as before)
- if the full host if longer than 63 characters we split
  by dots and we only use the part of the host before
  the first dot

Labels changes:
- Added `unidle-key` label to resources selected by the unidler
  to be more explicit than just using `host`.
- `host` label stays there as it's used in old `alpha` by
  unidler. We'll remove once `alpha` is retired
- `host` label is only kept for `Ingress`, `Deployment` and
  `Service` as there are the only `host` labels used by unidler
  (the rest were just added for consistency for human debugging
  but could lead to confusion, so removing)


## [0.4.5] - 2019-10-25
### Changed
- Truncate `host` label to make sure it's less than 63
  characters once we move to new domain.


## [0.4.4] - 2019-10-21
### Added
Added `priorityClassName` to pod spec
Updated `Deployment` APIGroup


## [0.4.3] - 2019-08-23
### Changed
Bumped auth-proxy to version v5.2.1.
This version removes the non-standard `prompt=none`.
Also note that v5.2.0 introduced support for logic to log into kibana.

This shouldn't be a breaking change.

improve startup time for users.

### Changed
- Adjusted `livenessProbe` and `readinessProbe` to bigger values for Jupyter container


## [0.1.10] - 2018-10-19
### Changed
- Added `livenessProbe` to be sure pods are terminated when unhealthy
- Reduced probes' `periodSeconds` from `5` to `2`
- Renamed ports in `Deployment` to `proxy`/`jupyter` instead of using `http`
  for everything which could lead to confusion
- Fixed indentation in `Deployment` YAML file


## [0.1.9] - 2018-10-16
