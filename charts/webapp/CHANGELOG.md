## [2.3.9] - 2020-05-15
### Changed
Bumped auth-proxy from `v5.2.4` to `v5.2.5`.

This fixes a problem with a broken image on the login screen. See: https://github.com/ministryofjustice/analytics-platform-auth-proxy/pull/250

## [2.3.8] - 2020-01-31
### Changed
Bumped auth-proxy from `v5.2.2` to `v5.2.4`.

This version updates some of the dependencies, [including
`handlebars` `4.7.2`](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/analytics-platform-auth-proxy/pull/214)
which fixes a security vulnerability.

See:
- https://github.com/ministryofjustice/analytics-platform-auth-proxy/releases/tag/v5.2.4
- https://github.com/ministryofjustice/analytics-platform-auth-proxy/releases/tag/v5.2.3


## [2.3.7] - 2020-01-06
### Changed
Reverted removal of `host` label.

It's not only used by the [*restarter* service](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/analytics-platform-restarter) but
it's also causing some webapp deployments to fail because
of a new constraint on labels in `apps/v1` which means
they can't change

SEE: [kubernetes issue on GitHub](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/26202)


## [2.3.6] - 2019-11-20
### Changed
Update URL for crown logo


## [2.3.5] - 2019-11-04
### Changed

## [2.3.4] - 2019-10-25

  characters once we move to new domain.
- Use `hostname` helper in NOTES.txt


## [2.3.3] - 2019-10-23
### Added
Added `Values.secretEnv.` to values.yaml and added secret that can be overridden by thh helm values override. This is to set dynamic env vars from AWS Parameters when deploying.

### Added
Added `spec.selector.matchLabels` to deployment spec

## [2.3.1] - 2019-10-21

## [2.3.0] - 2019-09-18

## [2.2.0] - 2019-08-27
### Changed
Add some security headers by default:

  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - X-Frame-Options: deny

## [2.1.1] - 2019-08-23
### Changed
Bumped auth-proxy to version v5.2.1.
This version removes the non-standard `prompt=none`.
Also note that v5.2.0 introduced support for logic to log into kibana.

This shouldn't be a breaking change.

https://github.com/ministryofjustice/analytics-platform-auth-proxy/releases/tag/v5.2.1


## [2.1.0] - 2019-07-23
### Changed
Bumped `auth-proxy` to version [`v5.0.0`](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/analytics-platform-auth-proxy/releases/tag/v5.0.0).

## [2.0.0] - 2019-05-29
### Changed
Replaced fluentd with [fluent-bit].

fluent-bit is much lighter than fluentd which means the
logging sidecar container doesn't require much CPU/memory anymore.

Just for comparison the memory limit was 1000Mi while now it's at 50Mi.
Even that is conservatively "high" as it's not clear at this stage
how much resources fluent-bit will use in real-life scenarios.

We bumped the major version of the helm chart as the fluent-bit
resources values are now under `FluentBit.Resources` while previously they
were at the top level.

[fluent-bit]: https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/v/1.1/


## [1.4.1] - 2019-05-21
### Changed
Bumped `auth-proxy` to version [`v4.0.1`](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/analytics-platform-auth-proxy/releases/tag/v4.0.1).

This version of the proxy reads the `X-Forwarded-For` header

- Added `readinessProbe` to webapp container
- Reduced proxy probe's `periodSeconds` to `2`

### Changed
- Update ingress object created by this chart to have a tls block (required by
  nginx + nlb ingress)

- Mismatched `FLUENT_ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME` env var in configmap

## [1.3.12] - 2018-07-16
### Changed
- After upgrading Elasticsearch. The webapp logs stopped working after a few days.
  This was due to deprecations with mappings and Elasticsearch 6 not supporting multiple mapping per index.
  See: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.0/breaking-changes-6.0.html
  Setting `type_name` to resolve this as fluentd-elasticsearch-plugin sets two mappings.
- Switched to using the more stable Kubernetes tested fluentd image. Made config changes to deployment accordingly.
- Fixed "No Method" error on `time_nano` filter


## [1.3.11] - 2018-07-16
