- Added `readinessProbe` to webapp container
- Reduced proxy probe's `periodSeconds` to `2`

- Update ingress object created by this chart to have a tls block (required by
  nginx + nlb ingress)

## [1.3.14] - 2018-08-02
### Changed
- Update auth-proxy to v0.1.4, which fixes the login loop problem which happens
  when a user fails to login but is redirected back to the login page without an

## [1.3.13] - 2018-07-17
### Changed
- Mismatched `FLUENT_ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME` env var in configmap
- Set reload on failure to __false__.  See: https://github.com/uken/fluent-plugin-elasticsearch/issues/257#issuecomment-348946393


## [1.3.12] - 2018-07-16
### Changed
- After upgrading Elasticsearch. The webapp logs stopped working after a few days.
  This was due to deprecations with mappings and Elasticsearch 6 not supporting multiple mapping per index.
  See: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.0/breaking-changes-6.0.html
  Setting `type_name` to resolve this as fluentd-elasticsearch-plugin sets two mappings.
- Switched to using the more stable Kubernetes tested fluentd image. Made config changes to deployment accordingly.
- Fixed "No Method" error on `time_nano` filter


## [1.3.11] - 2018-07-16
### Changed
- Use [auth-proxy `v0.1.3`](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/analytics-platform-auth-proxy/releases/tag/v0.1.3) which upgrades login-passwordless page to use `lock` library instead of `lock-passwordless`


## [1.3.10] - 2018-07-03
### Changed

- Increased memory resources from 256MB(default if unspecified) to 512MB

  a syntax error and adds a proper healthcheck endpoint
